bus mall project

Today, day 02 of Bus Mall project, Matthew Parker helped me out ALOT. He showed me how to render my images to the page. He reminded me how to create an event handler and an event listener, and to use a counter that tracks clicks and times shown. His code and my code most likely look very similar because I got a lot of help from him. Now I am working on the chart mostly by myself.
